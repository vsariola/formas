This intro uses the brotli compression technique so needs the web-server to be
configured properly i.e. to serve the file with
  a) content-type as "text/html"; and
  b) content-encoding as "br"

Some servers are already configured to serve .htm.br this way, but included in
the package is two mini servers, one for node and one for python3, that you can
use to serve the file. Just run:

node node-server.js
	OR
python python-server.py

And then open your browser to:

http://localhost:1337

Please use Chrome or Edge, Firefox seems to have issues with garbage collection.
